/**
 * In eager initialization, the instance of Singleton Class is created at the time of class loading, this is the
 * easiest method to create a singleton class but it has a drawback that instance is created even though client
 * application might not be using it.
 * <p>
 * If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the approach to use. But in most of the scenarios,
 * Singleton classes are created for resources such as File System, Database connections, etc. We should avoid the
 * instantiation until unless client calls the getInstance method. Also, this method doesnâ€™t provide any options for
 * exception handling.
