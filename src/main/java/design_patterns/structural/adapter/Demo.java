/**
 * The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern and is also known as the Wrapper Design Pattern.
 * This design pattern acts as a bridge between two different interfaces. It can convert the interface of a class,
 * to make it compatible with a client who is expecting a different interface, without changing the source code
 * of the class.
